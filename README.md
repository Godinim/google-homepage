# google-homepage
Part of "The Odin Project" https://www.theodinproject.com/. 
The first project for understanding the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. 
Please check README to show project analysis.

Although it looks similar to the actual google homepage, there are few problems in terms of functionality. Due to the lack of knowledge before beginning the project, I further studied on how I am able to improve the code such that the functionality would work similarly to the actual homepage. This list includes:

    1. Links should be included for the clickable items (Gmail, Images, Advertising, Business, ect.) with <a> and </a> tags. [HTML]
    2. Use code to show better understanding of padding, border and margins. [CSS]
    3. Change the UI to have a min and max height and width. [CSS]
    4. Better orientate text to keep their exact places. [CSS]
